## Description

  This jupyter notebook `main.pynb` file is an anaylsis of Seattle, Washington's crime data from the police department from 2008 through 2020. This project was developed to identify crime trends by date and by neighborhood. One can access total crime data and/or specific crimes, in the whole city and/or specific neighborhoods. This project was also created to identify changes in crime trends over time. Developers used `.csv` files along with many pandas libraries to clear and view graphs of the data. A new user could upload their own data and use these calculations to analyze it.

  The notebook allows the user to access different timeframes like 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. When focusing on these individual years, the user can see a graph during these years of the types of crimes and see how particular crimes change seasonally or with current events.
