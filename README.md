# seattle-crime-analysis

## **Introduction**

This jupyter notebook `seattle_crime_analysis.ipynb` file is an anaylsis of Seattle, Washington's crime data from the police department from 2008 through 2020. This project was developed to identify crime trends by date and by neighborhood. One can access total crime data and/or specific crimes, in the whole city and/or specific neighborhoods. This project was also created to identify changes in crime trends over time. Developers used `.csv` files along with many pandas libraries to clear and view graphs of the data. A new user could upload their own data and use these calculations to analyze it.

## **Technologies**
Python 3.10 and the following packages:

* [csv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) -- Used to store all of our SPD data

* [fire](https://github.com/google/python-fire) - *version 0.4.0* - This allows us to execute any fuction defined in a python file, using the terminal/ Command Line Interface so that you can call the function while on the terminal.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - *version 3.4.4* - Used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - For the visualization of crowdfunding data.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - This provides the ability to work with arrays and use different mathematical calculations on arrays.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For the analysis of crowdfunding data.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - This provides the ability to work with arrays and use different mathematical calculations on arrays.

## **Installation Guide**
On the terminal, under the conda dev environment, install the following packages and dependencies before running the crime analysis application
